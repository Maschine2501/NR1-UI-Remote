### This is the Remote version of [Maschine2501/NR1-UI](https://github.com/Maschine2501/NR1-UI/)

# NR1-UI-Remote:
This Code is a Remote-Control for Volumio (and NR1-UI).
It is functional without NR1-UI, you justt need to enable the [Album-Cover Tool](https://github.com/Maschine2501/Album-Art-Tool/tree/main).
If you use NR1-UI -> Album-Cover tool is implemented in Setup, you only need to activate it.

This is based on latest [Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf_latest)

In my case, I use a raspberry Pi Zero with an ssd1351 oled and a Li-On Shield (18650)

The project is not finished yet... !

I try to assist you, if you got questions or even problems with the code, just contact me.

Time by time more informations in the [wiki](https://github.com/Maschine2501/NR1-UI-Remote/wiki) will follow...

## The Code is now modular:
